Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of Deadspin for exposing the Manti Teo fiasco
or mentally troubled or a con
Not believable that Manti Teo was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died He is either very stupid
Can it just be new age that Manti Teo fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax
IMO Manti Teo was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy
ESPNs apologyBrent Musburger was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before
Dumbass BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice
BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot and maybe he will stop making offers he cant afford
BillMahers show is great for helping me get to sleep better than Sominex
HBO should fire BillMaher and bring back DennisDMZ someone that is actually funny
Ill bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didnt do the interview with Oprah hes saying to himself what was I thinking
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide

LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips Good move Lisa CelebApprentice
I always believed BretMichaels was making a mistake in coming back as a competitor I disagree with him but
I cant believe he would choose OMAROSA as his first choice She is hard to handle CelebApprentice
IvankaTrump and PiersMorgan will be wonderful advisors CelebApprentice
PiersMorgan and OMAROSA really hate each other CelebApprentice
THEGaryBusey is definitely different CelebApprentice
DennisRodman must be thinking of North Korea CelebApprentice
KellyandMichael are both wonderful people Their show is terrific CelebApprentice
OMAROSA as a cashier a big mistake by BrandenRoderick CelebApprentice

Dont worry West Coast etc we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs CelebApprentice
IvankaTrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty CelebApprentice
PiersMorgan is right he won the show because I know how to play the game CelebApprentice

So what did you think of my decision What would you have done CelebApprentice
I will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 AM this morning

Jon Stewart TheDailyShow is a total phony he should cherish his pastnot run from it

President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt Bowe Bergdahl Another US loss
The US cannot negotiate with terrorists It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster
At some point Sgt Bergdahl will have to explain his capture In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon Many questions
The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News
Another Obama disaster
ArsenioHall just got firedthe people spoke ratings were terrible The Apprentice brought him back from the dead but he blew it
Entrepreneurs  If you cannot handle the tough times you will never be successful in business Stay positive amp stay strong
Entrepreneurs Keep your momentum going Its a big factor in sustaining your success Keep moving forward
That the Obama administration didnt know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl OrangeRoom
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to Solders died looking for him US should NEVER have made the deal PUNISHMENT
Great deal we swap 5 killer terrorists for a US military deserter Thats how the US negotiates nowadays
President said we would never leave a soldier behind How about the 4 who died in Benghazi

Remember our six brave heroes who died searching for Bergdahl after he deserted
The entrepreneurs ability to dream to win lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit  Midas Touch

BretBaier   Why do you have George Will on your show  hes exhausted boring and not even a little relevant Waste of good airtime
I do what I do out of pure enjoyment Hopefully nobody does it better Theres a beauty to making a great deal Its my canvas
georgewillf is perhaps the most boring political pundit on television Got thrown off ABC like a dog At MaraLago he was a total bust
For all of the haters and losers out there sorry I never went Bankrupt  but I did build a world class company and employ many people
Just returned from New Hampshire where the crowd was greatand got a beautiful standing ovation Wonderful people who truly love the USA
I will be interviewed on foxandfriends at 700  30 minutes Some very interesting topics
So much dishonest reporting or nonreporting in political mediaan amazing experience for me BretBaier
How does failed writer and pundit like stephenfhayes with no success and little talent get away with criticizing candidates
Thank you JeffJlpa1 and AmSpec for the wonderful and very true article Total Desperation on Iran

We are getting ready to protect Saudi Arabia against Iran amp otherssending ships  How much are they going to pay us toward this protection
We are stupidly paying Iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying Why isnt this part of the nuclear negotiations Really dumb
As I have long been saying South Africa is a total  and very dangerous  mess Just watch the evening news when not talking weather

When you cant make them see the light make them feel the heat  Ronald Reagan
JonahNRO You stated that I started relentlessly tweeting like a 14yearold girl  Horrible insult to women Resign now or later
People have been forced to resign positions for far less than JonahNROs tweeting like a 14 year old girl
With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses tweeting like a 14 year old girl to hit me no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly JonahNRO
Im a conservative but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other whereas liberals unite to win
The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that Im the only Repub who wont cut Social Security etc Ill make America rich again
NRO JonahNRO  Wow just looked at the stats for National Review Dying fast doing very little business Save this conservative voice
JonahNRO  You should be totally focused on trying to save the badly failing National Review instead of focusing on me Work hard  NRO

Congratulations to the Republicans in Congress You are the only people Obama can out negotiate TimeToGetTough
I want to negotiate my own and much better trade deals for our country MUST INCLUDE CURRENCY MANIPULATION and more DO NOT LET PASS
No amnesty Protect the rule of law Lets Make America Great Again
The TransPacific Partnership is an attack on Americas business It does not  stop Japans currency manipulation This is a bad deal
Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade The TransPacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
The TransPacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment Do not pass it
China has a backdoor into the TransPacific Partnership This deal does not address currency manipulation China is laughing at us

Wow 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore some badly Where is the National Guard Police must get tough and fast Thugs must be stopped
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots SAD
Our great African American President hasnt exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the US taxpayers expected to rebuild it again
The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy  another real genius
Our country has to come together We have to start working with and really liking  each other The whole world is watching Baltimore
President Obama you have a big job to do Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together With proper leadership it can be done Do it
The best social program by far is a JOB Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries  incompetent leader
Hopefully there wont be any problems in Baltimore tonight Be calm be cooldo not let anybody get hurtThere is just too much to live for
I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots
I am going to Iowa today  sold out crowds People dont want our country rippedoff anymore Must stop now

They had no definitive proof against Tom Brady or patriots If Hillary doesnt have to produce Emails why should Tom Very unfair
Can you imagine we spend billions of dollars protecting Saudi Arabia and now the King refuses to even meet with Obama Great leadership
People are so jealous of Tom Brady and the Patriots No court could convict based on the evidenceThey cant beat him on the field so this
Why do we always try to destroy our true champions and winners in this country while at the same time leaving the losers alone STUPID

Mexicos biggest drug lord escapes from jail Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price  I told you so
Sleep eyes ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press Isnt he pathetic Love watching him fail
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison
Trump however would kick his ass
I hear that sleepy eyes chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press I cant imagine what is taking so long
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the US comes over border
but thats what Ive been saying Very unfair treatment by the media
The US will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a US citizen because our leaders cant say no
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the US
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border We get the killers drugs amp crime they get the money
When will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement Mexico is sending which turned out to be true  El Chapo
Isnt it interesting that now that Im 1 in the polls the networks show polls that are a month old
McLaughlinGroup Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend People of great accomplishment should easily quality for prez
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w my statements on border security
Mexicos totally corrupt govt looks horrible with El Chapos escapetotally corrupt US paid them 3 billion
El Chapo comes to the US often thru our borderits been revealed he has CA drivers license
Have some fun with this

Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on hit ads funded by lobbyists amp special interests Bad system
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates I am self funding
Congrats everyonewe topped 4 million today on Twitterand heading up fast
No more Clintons or Bushes
Many Super Pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to attack Trump Remember when u see them
Im turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributionsfeel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters

Jebs new slogan  Jeb can fix it I never thought of Jeb as a crook Stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor
Marco Rubio will not win Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered

Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio hes my friend Pure political speak Why cant he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend
seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice Never ran merely considered running
Rubio lied about my meeting w Hispanic activists I didnt change my opinion but treated them w respect Shame
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worsetrying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio So do two people who worked with him Said he used the wrong credit card Sure
Such bad reporting A puff piece on Ben Carson in the nytimes states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead But I am 1 easily Sad

Carson now admits his friend named Bob who he tried to stab Bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as Bob Wrong name

Todays WSJ Editorial is WRONG again I know that China is not in the new TPP trade deal but would come in latter through a back door
WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and TPP and apologize China not part but will get their way in later
The WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong so often They got info from an incorrect story in another pub Why not watch and listen to debate
When and how are the dummies at the WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me I want smart trade deals
Why wouldnt the WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong No wonder it is doing poorly
We as a country either have borders or we dont IF WE DONT HAVE BORDERS WE DONT HAVE A COUNTRY
KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP This moron wasted 430 million on political campaigns and lost 100
Why does the failing WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper
WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal
Total fool KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem An all talk no action dummy
Wow pres candidate Ben Carson who is very weak on illegal Immigration just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship

CarlyFiorina CarlyI did graduate from Wharton and did very well Who is your fact checker Will you apologize
CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper amp pathological disease I didnt say it he did Apology
CarlyFiorina I only said I was on 60Minutes four weeks ago with Putinnever said I was in Green Room Separate piecesgreat ratings
CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign
seanhannity  Carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope Sad

Heading now for Reno Nevada for a big rally Good poll numberd all over
Remember get TIME magazine I am on the cover Take it out in 4 years and read it again Just watch
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate
If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isnt questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who cant win
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows They arent worthy of representing the great people NH
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog For starters try getting a new publisher
Thank you to our law enforcement officers LESM Trump2016

Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors Horrible pictures amp images We are weak I will NOT forget
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails  virtually everything he touches Romney campaignhis booketc Why does andersoncooper put him on
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger Wont be that way if I win

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow I told you so
Ted Cruz said he didnt know that he was a Canadian Citizen He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million  loan papersNot believable
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand Not much of a reformer
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace Remember his wifes employer and his lender is located there
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didnt report another loan this one from Citi Wow no wonder banks do so well in the US Senate
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks
Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks They own him
Great new numbers Thank you MakeAmericaGreatAgain Trump2016
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite Says one thing for money does another for votes
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics
When will TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him
Greatly dishonest of TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form amp not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
Departing NH now great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth in a snow storm Thank you
Wow Ted Cruz received 487K in campaign contributions 11M from a NY hedge fund mogul amp 1M low int loan from Goldman Sachs Hypocrite

Ted Cruz didnt win Iowa he stole it That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated Bad
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for Cruz
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of F and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz Fraud
And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice  a total lie
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified
I will be interviewed on greta at 700 PM Enjoy FoxNews
This was sent out from Ted Cruz as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote CruzFraud
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud
Cruz just lied again I am and have been totally against ObamaCare repeal and replace
Dr Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger Shame
Pres Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately amp get home to Washington where a POTUS under a serious emergency belongs
Lyin Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad Be careful Lyin Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife
Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and openand let the Muslims flow in  No way
Thank you Arizona Trump2016WesternTuesday TrumpTrain
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona Thank you I will never forget
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices
Lyin Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the GQ model photo post of Melania Thats why we call him Lyin Ted
Thank you Arizona Trump2016MakeAmericaGreatAgain TrumpTrain
Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz Honestly I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are
I will be the best by far in fighting terror Im the only one that was right from the beginning amp now Lyin Ted amp others are copying me
I think having Jebs endorsement hurts Lyin Ted Jeb spent more than 0000 and got nothing I spent a fraction of that and am first
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
I want to thank RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win Could not have done it without you Joe
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
NATO is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of NATO Why It is time to renegotiate and the time is now
It is amazing how LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many TV shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly ZERO in his pres run
LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike  ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS do nothing
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing nytimes wrote a critical article I was so right
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE  AND FAST
TheView TV show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on I TELL THEM NO
Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs abc is wasting time
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe Also many in US  I TOLD YOU SO I alone can fix this problem
Europe and the US must immediately stop taking in people from Syria This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it So sad
Endorsements for Lyin Ted Cruz
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it If I lostmonster story
I didnt start the fight with LyinTed Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did He knew the PAC was putting it out  hence Lyin Ted
Wow just released that 67 million in negative ads was spent on me How am I still number one  by a lot
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking Weak leaders ridiculous laws
The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite
Lyin Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enqwere caused by me I had NOTHING to do with story
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J Trump Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong Illegals out
Wisconsins economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in US jobs are leaving I will make our economy strong again  bring in jobs
Dont believe the FoxNews Polls they are just another phony hit job on me I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election
Remember I am the only candidate who is selffunding While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others
I am interviewed on This Week on ABC this morning Enjoy
Wow sleepy eyes chucktodd is at it again He is do totally biased The things I am saying are correct  far better vision than the others

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race He said Kasich should get out for same reason I think both should get out

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didnt work Not much power or insight

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate I will defeat them both
Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American I say shes a fraud
Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie She is not Native American
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant She is too easy Im driving her nuts
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective Does nothing All talk no action  maybe her Native American name
Join me in Washington todaySpokane tickets

I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been she would lose
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage See mediaasking for increase
Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump amp gets nothing done in Senate
In interview I told AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue

The failing nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women they found nothing A joke
Everyone is laughing at the nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and womenI gave them many names of women I helpedrefused to use
Why doesnt the failing nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women The media is TOTALLY dishonest
Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing nytimes piece Massive front page for that
Why did the failing nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers DISHONEST
The media is really on a witchhunt against me False reporting and plenty of it  but we will prevail

That was an amazing interview on foxandfriends  I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the nytimes is
The nytimes is so dishonest Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie
Wow Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing nytimes story yesterday was on foxandfriends saying Times lied
A political commentator for cnn which I no longer watch said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries I set alltime record
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud
Thank you Anthony Scaramucci WSJ The Entrepreneurs Case for Trump
Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing nytimes story yesterday joined foxandfriends
The failing nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women
No wonder the nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false malicious amp libelous story they did on me
Over 50 women were interviewed by the nytimes yet they only wrote about 6 Thats because there were so many positive statements
The writer of the now proven false story in the nytimes Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond

Election is being rigged by the media in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign by putting stories that never happened into news
They let Crooked amp the Gang off the hook for the crime but it looks like the coverup is just as bad Unbelievable
A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill 1 million for his birthday SO CORRUPT
Hillarys staff thought her email scandal might just blow over Who would trust these people with national security
Weve all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme Wikileaks may have found the answer Obama
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary  but also at many polling places  SAD
The vast majority felt she should be prosecuted  even senior FBI officials thought Crooked was guilty

I will be interviewed on 60Minutes tonight after the NFL game  700 PM Enjoy
The debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS gave us the win
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  NY Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play Campaigning is much different
Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions I am the only one who knows who the finalists are

I cancelled todays meeting with the failing nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment Not nice
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the nytimes In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone
The failing nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high I can fully understand that  but why announce
Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years

The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated amp demoralized Dems
The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted Not so anymore
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in Nothing will change
Hillarys debate answer on delay That is horrifying That is not the way our democracy works Been around for 240 years Weve had free 016 2false744Twitter for Androidand fair elections Weve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a 016 false064Twitter for Androidduring a general election I for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind 016 false017Twitter for Androidof position Then separately she stated He said something truly horrifying  he refused to say that he would respect the results of 016 false608Twitter for Androidthis election That is a direct threat to our democracy She then said We have to accept the results and look to the future Donald 016 4false064Twitter for AndroidTrump is going to be our President We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead So much time and money will be spent  same result Sad
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
It would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4
states instead of the 15 states that I visited I would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten
Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California  so why isnt the media reporting on this Serious bias  big problem
If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people the CubanAmerican people and the US as a whole I will terminate deal
Just met with General Petraeuswas very impressed
CNN is so embarrassed by their total  100 support of Hillary Clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they dont know what to do
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory  306
I thought that CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however since election they are worse
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag  if they do there must be consequences  perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail

The US is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses but any business that leaves our country for another country
fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US
without retribution or consequence is WRONG There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35 for these companies
wanting to sell their product cars AC units etc back across the border This tax will make leaving financially difficult but
these companies are able to move between all 50 states with no tax or tariff being charged Please be forewarned prior to making a very
expensive mistake THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS

Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election Wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations He doesnt know much
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states  and more They focused on wrong states
Yes it is true  Carlos Slim the great businessman from Mexico called me about getting together for a meeting We met HE IS A GREAT GUY
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult amp sophisticated than the popular vote Hillary focused on the wrong states
I would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote  but would campaign differently
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss

Why is it that the Fake News rarely reports Ocare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives Its dead
Great jobs report today  It is all beginning to work
The reason I am staying in Bedminster N J a beautiful community is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive Meetings

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington Republican and Democrat alike When things calm down they will be thanking me
Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke Richie devised one of the greatest military frauds in US history For

Yesterday on the same day I had meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the FM of Ukraine Pavlo
Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians amp Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election
The Fake Media is working overtime today
As a very active President with lots of things happening it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy
Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future press briefings and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy
James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press
When James Clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt says there is no collusion when does it end

It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the FakeNews media
Whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media and they dont mention names

WEEKLY ADDRESS
Just out The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia Did nothing about it WHY
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums amp deductibles increase by over 100 Remember keep your doctor keep your plan
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action Focus on them not T
Obama Administration official said they choked when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election They didnt want to hurt Hillary
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders Is she allowed to so collude Unfair to Bernie
I am on foxandfriends  Enjoy
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas All they do is delay and complainThey own ObamaCare
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win
and did not want to rock the boat He didnt choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling With 4 months looking at Russia
under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of T people colluding There is no collusion amp no obstruction I should be given apology
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats Not easy Perhaps just let OCare crash amp burn
Very grateful for the 9O decision from the U S Supreme Court We must keep America SAFE
From FoxNews Bombshell In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election  Check out his statement  Witch Hunt
Great day for Americas future Security and Safety courtesy of the US Supreme Court I will keep fighting for the American people amp WIN

With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard
I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare They really want to get it right unlike OCare
The failing nytimes writes false story after false story about me They dont even call to verify the facts of a story A Fake News Joke

Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now amp work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate Dems will join in
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans Most Republicans were loyal terrific amp worked really hard We will return
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan Stay tuned
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House amp Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes Even parts of full Repeal need 60 8 Dems control Senate Crazy
Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is sick All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany Press knew
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister

The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is amp it will get even better at lunchtimeThe Dems scream death as OCare dies

As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians
Its very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President

If Republicans dont Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand
Thank you to LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A SCreg cuttingStock M jobsborder etc  TRUE

Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist
Never in UShistory has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal He told stories about his Vietnam battles and
conquests how brave he was and it was all a lie He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child Now he judges collusion
On PurpleHeartDayI thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION USA
The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Councils 150 vote in favor of sanctions on N Korea
How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability and nonexistent sources remain in business
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI He has pled guilty to those lies It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful There was nothing to hide
62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history
Great job First Lady Melania
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her Rigged system or just a double standard
Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and acid washed  Emails No justice
Congratulations to ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt More Networks and papers should do the same with their Fake News
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie
Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco
Tainted no very dishonest FBI agents role in Clinton probe under review Led Clinton Email probe foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters  worst in History But fear not we will bring it back to greatness
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of ABC News he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused  many millions of dollars
Report ANTITRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE  Now it all starts to make sense
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life VA Judges 2nd Amendment and more No to Jones a PelosiSchumer Puppet

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media They are out of control  correct reporting means nothing to them Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposeda stain on America
Another false story this time in the Failing nytimes that I watch 48 hours of television a day  Wrong  Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the dumbest man on television Bad Reporting
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia  so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I dont know andor have never met FAKE NEWS

The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media

Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer Should be charging MUCH MORE
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration amp ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc We must protect our Country at all cost

Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice The world is watching

Thank you GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy Couldnt agree wyou more TOGETHER we are MAGA
ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 5 to keep fellow Americans SAFE Everyone is so gratefulLawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident realDonaldTrump
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case such as DACA always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between TrumpRussia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace Must have tough Primary
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion amp yet on and on it goes Russia amp the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing Republicans should finally take control
I want to thank my Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Disproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers Where are Crooked Hillary Emails  What a mess
In new Quinnipiac Poll 66 of people feel the economy is Excellent or Good That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll
House votes on controversial FISA ACT today This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others
45 year low in illegal immigration this year foxandfriends
With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and todays vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land We need it Get smart
Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS amp JOBS ACT

More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than 1 BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavytruck production from Mexico to Michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying 2000 bonus to US employees
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for TrumpPence Plenty of more to follow
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold  a first
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery amp Chain USA
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbonNO
The socalled bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain amp Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
countries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund
Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made  a big setback for DACA
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country Never said take them out Made up by Dems I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians Probably should record future meetings  unfortunately no trust

Yesterday was a big day for the stock market Jobs are coming back to America Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing American business is hot again
The Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too bad
AMERICA FIRST
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market Chrysler coming back to US Michigan from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED It was headed for disaster
I dont believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad
So much Fake News is being reported They dont even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un of N Korea Obviously I didnt say that I said Id have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters
and they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWS
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats dont really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries AMERICA FIRST
President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy Tax Cut bonuses to more than 00 workers Most explosive Stock Market rally that weve seen in modern times  to  from Election and grounded in profitability and growth All Trump not 0
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline Thank you Stuart Varney  foxandfriends
Statement by me last night in Florida Honestly I dont think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA but they dont want to helpWe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they dont want to They dont want security at the border they dont want
to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST amp MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting Deals cant get made when there is no trust Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets it
90 of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative and much of it contrivedfoxandfriends

The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water
The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous 71 billion dollar trade surplus with the US The 20 billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the US NAFTA is a bad joke
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election March 13 Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world If there is no Wall there is no Deal
CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension

Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with SenSchumer  working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with SenateMajLdr McConnell and SpeakerRyan Making progress  four week extension would be best
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety amp Security on the very dangerous Southern Border Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present DemocratShutdown
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60 That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election We can then be even tougher on  Crime and Border and even better to our Military amp Veterans

Thank you to Brad Blakeman on FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an Aand likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements Working hard

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients amp a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons 1 Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem 2 To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it
Democrats are not interested in Border Safety amp Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military They are only interested in Obstruction

The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans  something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago Rank amp File are great people
You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team Tom Fitton JW

This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead This is an American disgrace
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks about them Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermathThe FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe FBI became
a tool of antiTrump political actors This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the lawThe FBI wasnt straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators Wall Street Journal

Thank you to foxandfriends for exposing the truth Perhaps thats why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information Must be stopped
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA Make a deal
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure

Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration amp cancels the visa lottery If Ds oppose this deal they arent serious about DACAthey just want open borders
We need a 21st century MERITBASED immigration system  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security

Just signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything  and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election
Costs on nonmilitary lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to redo and send back in proper form
According to the nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the US Asking price was 10 million brought down to 1 million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing amp understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out  DRAIN THE SWAMP
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused  life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process
My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the ClintonDNC Dossier it shows that hes been victimized Hes been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of
agencies not just the FBI amp DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I dont believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on FoxNews
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in 011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republican
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the WestervillePD
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans
So many positive things going on for the USA and the Fake News Media just doesnt want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history    MAGA
42 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus andor Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut amp Jobs Billand it will only get better We are far ahead of schedule

As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of AfricanAmericans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation

My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities again and again
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA
In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil  and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need
The SchumerRoundsCollins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe DHSgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesnt build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
lottery continues deadly catchandrelease and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth  but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many fronts
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned Republicans are still working hard
Russia started their antiUS campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong  no collusion
Our entire Nation wone heavy heart continues to pray for the victims amp their families in Parkland FL To teachers law enforcement first responders amp medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger We THANK YOU for your courage
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida Will never forget them or the evening
Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the nypost succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the oldfashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election
Funny how the Fake News Media doesnt want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didnt know
The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was NOT the main goalRob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads
Just like they dont want to solve the DACA problem why didnt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House amp Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didnt want to and now they just talk
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign  there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send 17 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation
Finally Liddle Adam Schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia  it never did
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election But wasnt I a great candidate
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the US then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last 4 weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans

Have a great but very reflective Presidents Day
Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election So why didnt he do something about Russian meddling
Mitt Romney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to OrrinHatch and has my full support and endorsement
The US economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations amp Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS JOBS JOBS
The Faith of Donald Trump a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read Enjoy
Thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig Americas elections theres no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so Id invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes
The President Obama quote just before election Thats because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didnt want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA Rs want to fix
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House Youve come a long way Matt
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Dont let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes amp waste money
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts Total Fake News
A woman I dont know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live security
cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesnt washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only FoxNews so reporteddoesnt fit the Mainstream Media narrative
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law This shows smallbusiness owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses
Bad ratings CNN amp MSNBC got scammed when they covered the antiTrump Russia rally walltowall They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
So true thank you
CNN MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why arent they the subject of the investigation Why didnt Obama do something about the meddling Why arent Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Session
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead There was nobody like him He will be missed by Christians and all religions A very special man

FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham Our prayers are with his children grandchildren greatgrandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families So much love in the midst of so much pain We must not let them down We must keep our children safeFull Listening Session
I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News CNN amp NBC What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience  only the best 20 of teachers a lot would now be able to
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this Far more assets at much less cost than guards A gun free school is a magnet for bad people ATTACKS WOULD END
History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes It takes police amp first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime Highly trained gun adept teacherscoaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive GREAT DETERRENT
If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school Cowards wont go thereproblem solved Must be offensive defense alone wont work
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue  I hope
What many people dont understand or dont want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots They love our Country and will do the right thing                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 1130 AM to discuss School Safety  Next week it will be with our Nations Governors Its been many years of all talk no action Well get it done

Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored We say a prayer for our country that all across this land the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God

The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the US for many years Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead Sorry its time for a change MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for USA Massive relocation of companies amp jobs Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new amp fair NAFTA agreement is signed Also Canada must
treat our farmers much better Highly restrictive Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the US They have not done what needs to be done Millions of people addicted and dying
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel AMERICA FIRST

Californias sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk Thousands of dangerous amp violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans THIS MUST STOP
If we dont have a wall system were not going to have a country Congress must fund the BORDER WALL amp prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country amp the people of our country We must enforce our laws amp protect our people BuildTheWall

US Consumer Confidence Hits 14Year High
Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI  A great day for Democracy Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI
Happy StPatricksDay
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice amp State DrainTheSwamp
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wifes campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation How many lies How many leaks Comey knew it all and much more
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign WITCH HUNT
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous source He said strongly never no He lied as shown clearly on foxandfriends
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me I dont believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date Same with lying James Comey Can we call them Fake Memos
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans Another Dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair And yet there is NO COLLUSION
seanhannity on foxandfriends now Great 818 AM
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest

AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD Great job by law enforcement and all concerned
Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona I agree with LouDobbs Should have sought review
Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice  So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz
Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama called him also The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him They are wrong Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing
They can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine ISIS Iran and even the coming Arms Race Bush tried to get along but didnt have the smarts Obama and Clinton tried but didnt have the energy or chemistry remember RESET PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH
Got 16 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming Most importantly got 700 Billion to rebuild our Military 716 Billion next yearmost ever Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment
Democrats refused to take care of DACA Would have been so easy but they just didnt care I had to fight for Military and start of Wall
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault He doesnt know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way Dont threaten people Joe
Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillarys large and highly sophisticated staff Well not saying that anymore

DACA was abandoned by the Democrats Very unfair to them Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 0 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats not even mentioned in Bill and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill  100 PM
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks BAD IDEA As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns
As a matter of National Security Ive signed the Omnibus Spending Bill I say to Congress I will NEVER sign another bill like this again To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again Im calling on Congress to give me a lineitem veto for all govt spending bills
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday and we grieve the nations loss We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support We are with you EmmanuelMacron
France honors a great hero Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism Even stronger measures needed especially at borders
Because of the 700 amp 716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich Building a great Border Wall with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense Build WALL through M
Much can be done with the 16 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall It is just a down payment Work will start immediately The rest of the money will come  and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you but we will not
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia casedont believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on Fame amp fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted Problem is that a new
lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country  and I am very happy with my existing team Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems
Happy National MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES We love you

We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio A tremendous honor to be here today at a stateoftheart training site where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined

Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair No more Its time to REBUILD and we will do it with American WORKERS American GRIT and American PRIDE
While we are on the subject it is reported that the US Post Office will lose 150 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon That amounts to Billions of Dollars The Failing NY Times reports that the size of the companys lobbying staff has ballooned and that
does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a lobbyist and should so  REGISTER If the PO increased its parcel rates Amazons shipping costs would rise by 26 Billion This Post Office scam must stop Amazon must pay real costs and taxes now

Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal Democrat laws like Catch amp Release Getting more dangerous Caravans coming Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW NO MORE DACA DEAL
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the US They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA NEED WALL
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the act
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws
Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents and ICE are GREAT but the weak Dem laws dont allow them to do their job Act now Congress our country is being stolen
DACA is dead because the Democrats didnt care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws  ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the US hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke
Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field
So sad that the Department of Justice and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress An embarrassment to our country
An honor to host the Annual WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake amp Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama Mueller is most conflicted of all except Rosenstein who signed FISA amp Comey letter No Collusion so they go crazy
Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking reelection he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question We are with you Paul

Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball

Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says Theres probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate

Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants Animals Wrong They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as Animals a big difference  and so true Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual
Why isnt disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the 0 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M under FBI investigation that they killed gave to McCabes wife in her run for office Then dropped case on Clinton

If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee also Senate Judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers Drain the Swamp
Things are really getting ridiculous The Failing and Crooked but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton nytimes has done a long amp boring story indicating that the Worlds most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia amp me so now they are looking at the rest of the World
At what point does this soon to be 000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they arent looking at the corruption
in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted  Emails got 0000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife 0 and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M and so much more Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the MidTerm Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party Dont worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of Democrats FBI They broke into homes amp offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server
and why hasnt the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington DC
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia  so now theyre looking at the rest of the World Oh great
I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBIDOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes  and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didnt President Obama amp the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc They did NOTHING With that being said Chuck amp I have long agreed on this issue Fair Trade plus with China will happen
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL FarmAgricultural Products  would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years
On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time
China must continue to be strong amp tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing
John Brennan is panicking He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of Americans faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the
top of the FBI Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony Dossierhe knows about the Dossier he denies knowledge of the Dossier he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier which
they then used to start an investigation about Trump It is that simple This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation Brennan has disgraced himself hes worried about staying out of Jail Dan Bongino

Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win  just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasnt a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered  many times higher than normal
foxandfriends  New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before What goes around comes around
Its clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman foxandfriends
Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No James Clapper I am not happy Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK

Elect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world Right now we have the dumbest and the worst Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing Remember their motto RESIST Ours is PRODUCE
Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmenwomen in November Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave

Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is So many people hurt so bad for our country  a total sham
Democrats fix the laws Dont RESIST We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country Strong Borders No Crime
We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country When somebody comes in we must immediately with no Judges or Court Cases bring them back from where they came Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order Most children come without parents
Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years Immigration must be based on merit  we need people who will help to Make America Great Again
The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers amp Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the USA Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street

RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement The Great State of Louisiana we want Clay
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower Actually far greater than would ever have been believed
The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI although I do not legally have to because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on But you do have to ask why the DOJ amp FBI arent giving over requested documents
Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama Fake News is working overtime
Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go  will always be disfunctional People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the US illegally Children brought back to their country
If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in its tracks  and at very little by comparison cost This is the only real answer  and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL
Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original fighters Governor Henry McMaster Speaking at 700 PM

Director David Lynch Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents
Why is Senator Mark Warner DVA perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows Isnt this highly illegal Is it being investigated
The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI amp DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see We should expose these people for what they are  there should be total transparency
Just landed in South Carolina  will be at the McMaster rally shortly MAGA
Thank you South Carolina Now lets get out tomorrow and VOTE for HenryMcMaster
Early this year HarleyDavidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand That was long before Tariffs were announced Hence they were just using TariffsTrade War as an excuse Shows how unbalanced amp unfair trade is but we will fix it
We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers workers and companies We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint They must play fair or they will pay tariffs
When I had HarleyDavidson officials over to the White House I chided them about tariffs in other countries like India being too high Companies are now coming back to America Harley must know that they wont be able to sell back into US without paying a big tax
We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the EU in that they have long taken advantage of the US in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs In the end it will all even out  and it wont take very long
It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN
A HarleyDavidson should never be built in another countrynever Their employees and customers are already very angry at them If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end  they surrendered they quit The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before
The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the futureand pick Crooked Hillary for Pres
The most profound question of our era Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the US and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy  Judge Andrew Napolitano

I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill either GOODLATTE 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov

The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country This is not fair nor is it acceptable While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office they must do much more Germany is at 1 the US is at 4 and NATO benefits
Europe far more than it does the US By some accounts the US is paying for 90 of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their 2 commitment On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of 151 Million with the US with big Trade Barriers on US goods NO
I have long heard that the most important decision a US President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice  Will be announced tonight at 900 PM
I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed amp even more importantly our handshake We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese TradeHope Not
The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out The US strongly supports breast feeding but we dont believe women should be denied access to formula Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty

NATO countries must pay MORE the United States must pay LESS Very Unfair

Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh SCOTUS
Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2 which is low but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made Will they reimburse the US
A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe US has a 151 Billion trade deficit and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it Just doesnt work

What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy Why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment The US is paying for Europes protection then loses billions on Trade Must pay 2 of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025

ExFBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress Wow but is anybody really surprised  Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER
How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI AgentLover Peter Strzok Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear
Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isnt nearly enough US spends too much Europes borders are BAD Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable
As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI LoverAgent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena amp is refusing to show up and testify What can she possibly say about her statements and lies So much corruption on the other side Where is the Attorney General FoxNews
Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia They pay only a fraction of their cost The US pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade
On top of it all Germany just started paying Russia the country they want protection from Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia Not acceptable All NATO Nations must meet their 2 commitment and that must ultimately go to 4

Where is the DNC Server and why didnt the FBI take possession of it Deep State
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administration Why didnt they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election
So funny I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time they are dying in the ratings to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta actually a nice guy They didnt But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin Fake News
Remember it was Little Jeff Z and his people who are told exactly what to say who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 over amp over again in the Electoral College I got 306 They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage Still hurting
Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years Why didnt Obama do something about it  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win thats why Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesnt want to report the truth as usual
There hasnt been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isnt the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts Because it is FAKE NEWS
Heading to Helsinki Finland  looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow Unfortunately no matter how well I do at the Summit if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia
over the years I would return to criticism that it wasnt good enough  that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems
know how to do is resist and obstruct This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country  but at some point it will heal
Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament  one of the best ever
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present amp future We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media NATO is now strong amp rich
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldnt happen was no big deal amp did NOTHING about it When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of US foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt

I had a great meeting with NATO They have paid 33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me NATO was weak but now it is strong again bad for Russia The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money

So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match Big results will come
While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with Russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success Many positive things will come out of that meeting
Russia has agreed to help with North Korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along There is no rush the sanctions remain Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process
Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve Enjoy

Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia They would rather go to war than see this Its called Trump Derangement Syndrome
34 million jobs created since our great Election Victory  far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition

Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs Likewise to Pfizer We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs
The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one  they actually want to abolish ICE This should cost them heavily in the Midterms Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE
The Fake News Media is going Crazy They make up stories without any backup sources or proof Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity But Ill complain anyway
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that Ill probably have a good relationship with Putin We are doing MUCH better than any other country
Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES Thank you to foxandfriends and FoxNews for actually showing the clips The Fake News wants no part of that narrative Too bad they dont want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set

My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri Such a tragedy such a great loss May God be with you all
China the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the US is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day  taking away our big competitive edge As usual not a level playing field
The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well Tightening now hurts all that we have done The US should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals Debt coming due amp we are raising rates  Really
Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years The price of soybeans has fallen 50 since 5 years before the Election A big reason is bad terrible Trade Deals with other countries They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers Canada charges 275 on Dairy Farmers will WIN

I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy If I was loud amp vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim Hypocrites
The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again  cant believe it Isnt it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart The 000 Commissioner must now make a stand First time kneeling out for game Second time kneeling out for seasonno pay
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyers office early in the morning  almost unheard of Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client  totally unheard of amp perhaps illegal The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong
The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama WH seems intent on damaging the Republican Partys chances in the November Election This Democrat excuse for losing the 16 Election never ends

Congratulations to JudicialWatch and TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam
Looking more amp more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC Ask her how that worked out  she did better with Crazy Bernie Republicans must get tough now An illegal Scam
Andrew McCarthy  I said this could never happen This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it It is so bad it screams out at you  On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt
PeteHegseth on FoxNews  Source 1 was the Fake Dossier Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate 1 Trump Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign ILLEGAL
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it So bad for our country
Happy Birthday SenatorDole

Tom Fitton on foxandfriends at 615 AM NOW Judicial Watch
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly amp falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt
It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team This is a Clinton Campaign document It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump
and the DOJ FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account Source 1 was the major source Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team Not about Carter Pagewas all about getting Trump
Carter Page wasnt a spy wasnt an agent of the Russians  he would have cooperated with the FBI It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump Tom Fitton JudicialWatch A disgrace to America They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months Likewise no Nuclear Tests Japan is happy all of Asia is happy But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that I am angry because it is not going fast enough Wrong very happy
The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the US Supreme Court two months ago Next up is the US Post Office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages
In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for Amazon Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought
Robert will do a great job for our Vets We also recently won Choice

Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off  Lost 817 Billion on Trade last year No weakness
When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity Negotiations are going really well be cool The end result will be worth it

Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major US Steel plant in Granite City Illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion
the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats so now they are looking at my Tweets along with 53 million other people  the rigged Witch Hunt continues How stupid and unfair to our CountryAnd so the Fake News doesnt waste my time with dumb questions NO
I did NOT know of the meeting with my son Don jr Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam Taxi cabs maybe He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillarys lawyer Gee I wonder if they helped him make the choice

Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with AG Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media amp how that Fake News has morphed into phrase Enemy of the People Sad
The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by 52 Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women
I would be willing to shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall Must get rid of Lottery Catch amp Release etc and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT We need great people coming into our Country
When the media  driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome  reveals internal deliberations of our government it  truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk Very unpatriotic Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news
accurately 90 of media coverage of my Administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving its no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low I will not allow our great country to be sold out by antiTrump haters in the
dying newspaper industry No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people As an example the failing New York Times
and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements  and they will never change
There is No Collusion The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 increased from 13 including an Obama White House lawyer Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam

FBI Agent Peter Strzok on the Mueller team should have recused himself on day one He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP He needed an insurance policy Those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the Election He should never ever been allowed to
remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated This is a real issue It wont go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation ALAN DERSHOWITZ
This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further Bob Mueller is totally conflicted and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA
Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders He worked for me for a very short time Why didnt government tell me that he was under investigation These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion  a Hoax
Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt Disgraceful
We already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was Hillary Clinton How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad Marc Thiessen Washington Post

Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated China market has dropped 27 in last 4months and they are talking to us Our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated America First
Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry Plants are opening all over the US Steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury Other countries use Tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream
Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today Only fools would disagree We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs We win either way
China which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and PR trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs because they are really hurting their economy Likewise other countries We are Winning but must be strong

Tariffs are working big time Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the US always to our detriment I say as they comeTax them If they dont want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the US In either event it means jobs and great wealth

Fake News reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower This was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics  and it went nowhere I did not know about it

such wonderful and powerful things about me  a true Champion of Civil Rights  until she got fired Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media they didnt want interviews when she worked in the White House Now that she says bad about me they will talk to her Fake News
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok amp his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI We know this
guy was corrupt and had antiTrump animus Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation Instead Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong He used Strzok he used the Clinton DNC Dossierthe whole thing
should be shut down The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors Thank you Judicial Watch I couldnt have said it better myself
Lou Dobbs This cannot go forwardthis Special Councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true
When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didnt work out Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog

Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department can you believe he is still there is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele find dirt on Trump Ohrs wife Nelly was in on the act big time  worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier foxandfriends
They were all in on it clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didnt do Gregg Jarrett on foxandfriends  If we had a real Attorney General this Witch Hunt would never have been started Looking at the wrong people
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt  why isnt this socalled probe ended immediately Why arent these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary
Lou Dobbs This cannot go forwardthis Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia The Dems are the ones who should be investigated Thank you Lou so true

Mark Levin When they had power they didnt stop the Russians the Chinese the North Koreans they funded the Iranians amp are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election amp trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency
Id strip the whole bunch of them Theyre all corrupt Theyve all abused their power Theyve all betrayed the American people with a political agenda They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States seanhannity
Our Economy is doing better than ever Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low amp business optimism is higher than it has ever been For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY It is very bad for our Great CountryBUT WE ARE WINNING
The Boston Globe which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 13 BILLION DOLLARS plus 800 million dollars in losses amp investment or 21 BILLION DOLLARS was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press PROVE IT
There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people HONESTY WINS

The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department amp whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok This is too crazy to be believed The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility
While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch  Catherine Herridge of FoxNews  LouDobbs  In other words they were colluding with Russia
Very concerned about Comeys firing afraid they will be exposed said Bruce Ohr DOJs Emails amp Notes show Bruce Ohrs connection to phony amp discredited Trump Dossier A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act Rigged Witch Hunt
TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place Now that is a really good question Then followed by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero So true a total Fake
How can Senator Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam pass judgement on anyone Loser
An incredibly corrupt FBI amp DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election Brennan has gone off the deep end hes disgraced and discredited himself His conduct has been outrageous Chris Farrell Judicial Watch
Director Brennans recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power If Director Brennans statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA why didnt he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment
released in 2017 If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office it constitutes an intelligence breach  Richard Burr RNC Senate Intel Cmte Chair  LouDobbs
In speaking with some of the worlds top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the US Stop quarterly reporting amp go to a six month system said one That would allow greater flexibility amp save money I have asked the SEC to study
How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the US survive making the statement WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT Which section of the sentence is worse
The local politicians who run Washington DC poorly know a windfall when they see it When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it Never let someone hold you up I will instead
attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date amp go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November 11th Maybe we will do something next year in DC when the cost comes WAY DOWN Now we can buy some more jet fighters
Just announced youth unemployment is at a 50 year low  foxandfriends

Wow Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about Americas lack of greatness I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better Andrew choked badly mistake
When a politician admits that Were not going to make America great again there doesnt seem to be much reason to ever vote for him This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resignhe will get higher ratings than his brother Chris
Which is worse Hightax Andrew Cuomos statement WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT or Hillary Clintons DEPLORABLES statement
I say Andrews was a bigger and more incompetent blunder He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress but his political career is over
Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the antiTrump Russia probe will be exposed  Charles Payne  FoxBusiness   How much more does Mueller have to see They have blinders on  RIGGED
Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy its astonishingthat hes still employed Bruce amp Nelly Ohrs bank account is getting fatter amp fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesnt disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal
Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy its astonishing that hes still employed Bruce amp Nelly Ohrs bank account is getting fatter amp fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling He doesnt disclose it under Fed Regs Using your Federal office for personal
financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation Bribery Statute Violation Honest Services Violationall Major Crimesbecause the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions  Gregg Jarrett  So when does Mueller do what must be done Probably never FoxNews
Social Media is totally discriminating against RepublicanConservative voices Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we wont let that happen They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others
Censorship is a very dangerous thing amp absolutely impossible to police If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN amp MSNBC amp yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or dont watch at all
Too many voices are being destroyed some good amp some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen Who is making the choices because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made Let everybody participate good amp bad and we will all just have to figure it out
All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction China But in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone
Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director He will go down as easily the WORST in history amp since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country
Great Job  Rachel CamposDuffy on foxandfriends
The Economy is stronger and better than ever before Importantly there remains tremendous potential  it will only get better with time
The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the US I want to develop the US our military and countries that help us
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents Most transparent in history No Collusion No Obstruction Witch Hunt
The failing nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type RAT But I allowed him and all others to testify  I didnt have to I have nothing to hide
and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close So many lives have been ruined over nothing  McCarthyism at its WORST Yet Mueller amp his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side  Media is even worse
No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crookeds Emails
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite  amp the two Fake reporters knew this This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People So bad for America
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times They actually called to complain and apologize  a big step forward From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse
Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby Rigged Witch Hunt
Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone
looking for trouble They are enjoying ruining peoples lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side  the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more Muellers Angry Dems are looking to impact the election They are a National Disgrace
Wheres the Collusion They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction of a phony crime that never existed If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction
I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our countrys history brings a lawsuit It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt He wont sue
Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance its worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan It certainly isnt because of the good job he did He is a political hack
Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions  Justice Department A total joke
Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multimillion dollar investigation into what apparently didnt happen Darrell Issa House Oversight We can take out the word apparently  FoxNews
It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the US Postal System from China We can and must END THIS NOW The Senate should pass the STOP ACT  and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country No more delay

I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family Justice took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to break  make up stories in order to get a deal Such respect for a brave man
A large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case Witch Hunt
Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled

I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
Additionally because of our much tougher Trading stance with China I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were despite the UN Sanctions which are in place
Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim I look forward to seeing him soon
Thank you I love you Ohio

How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department Disgraceful  Witch Hunt
StopTheBias
STATEMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSEPresident Donald J Trump feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government At the same time we also know that China is providing North Korea with
considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities This is not helpful Nonetheless the President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts
of money on joint USSouth Korea war games Besides the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses If he does they will be far bigger than ever before As for the USChina trade disputes and other
differences they will be resolved in time by President Trump and Chinas great President Xi Jinping Their relationship and bond remain very strong
CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake Sloppy carlbernstein a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool making up story after story is being laughed at all over the country Fake News

Ohr told the FBI it the Fake Dossier wasnt true it was a lie and the FBI was determined to use it anyway to damage Trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the Trump campaign This is a fraud on the court The Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court is in
charge of the FISA court He should direct the Presiding Judge Rosemary Collier to hold a hearing haul all of these people from the DOJ amp FBI in there amp if she finds there were crimes committed and there were there should be a criminal referral by her GreggJarrett

The hatred and extreme bias of me by CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function But actually as I have always said this has been going on for a long time Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job his ratings suck amp ATampT should fire him to save credibility

Ivanka Trump amp Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called pushing out of Don McGahnThe Fake News Media has it purposelyso wrong They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesnt existjust a smooth running machine with changing parts
